90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: HRH
90#VERS#COMMENT##: 1- The book consists of seven sections that have no
    effect on the structure of the book and should not be tagged. 2- The
    book contains an appendix at the end (PageV02P364) which has been added
    from two of the  manuscripts. 3- The book contains a lot of names that
    cannot be tagged structurally since they are inside the lines without
    any number or sign.
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
