90#VERS#COMMENT##: A few analytical tags in PageV01P004-7 that should be
    removed. 2- In some pages, a part of the footnote is entered into the
    text (sometimes with the explanatory word “(هامش *)” and sometimes
    without it).  3- PageV07P241-256 have not been typed (according to the
    note of the typist). 4- There is an appendix in PageV08P450.
    Maroussia: the (old) link in the yml file (https://archive.org/details/waq15291)
    refers to a truncated version with only 7 volumes, and the two missing volumes 
    are to be found separately under another link (https://archive.org/details/bukhari-kabir_8-9/08_15298/mode/2up)
    I would like to suggest this archive link: 
    https://archive.org/details/Tarikh_Kabir_Bukhari
    Although it seems to be a reprint from 2001 of the 1986 edition, 
    it has all the 9 volumes that are in the annotated file 
    (unfortunately with 3 extra volumes).
    All paratextual elements
