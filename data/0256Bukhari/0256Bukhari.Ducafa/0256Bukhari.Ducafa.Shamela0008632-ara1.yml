90#VERS#COMMENT##: Editpro edition was not found. I used another edition
    which is very different; nevertheless, it is enough for tagging since
    the structure of the book is very clear. It consists of a lot of names
    arranged according to alphabetical order.
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
