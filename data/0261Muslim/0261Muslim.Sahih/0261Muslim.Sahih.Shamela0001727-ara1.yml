90#VERS#COMMENT##: The text itself generally corresponds to the printed version.
            However, the pagination includes repetitions and many "V000P000" that appear
            next to headings. The annotation system is off because of of the numbering of
            the hadiths themselves.
           NOTE OF THE REVIEWER (HRH): Some second-level headers do not exist in the PDF and are typed unnumbered by the typist(s). I tagged them with an asterisk (### || *).  2- Find other editions: https://archive.org/details/SahihMuslimKarmi; https://archive.org/details/sahih.muslem_201904; https://archive.org/details/20191030_20191030_1310
