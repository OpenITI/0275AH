90#VERS#COMMENT##: In most places, dots are either removed or replaced by another punctuation mark (“ or ,). There are few mistakes in Editpad Pro version: some numbers in the text are wrong (V01P353, N. 732; V01P416, N 900; V02P094, N 1194; V02P307, N. 1554; V03P036, N. 1745) and some others are removed (V02P307, N 1555; V03P235, N 2033). After page 134 in Vol 5, there is a redundant word at the beginning of some pages, which is either the repetition of the first word of the page or something completely irrelevant (e.g. P. 134, 142, 147, 150, 162. 163, 164, 167, 168, 170, 173). Moreover, in this Volume, Pages 227-239 are repeated at the end of the pages (I didn’t tag this redundant part, since it must be deleted).
