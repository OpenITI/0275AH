90#VERS#COMMENT##: 1- Some pages include a section entitled: “تضمينات الحافظ ابن حجر”. Both in the PDF and in Editpro text, this part is separated by dotted lines (and I didn’t change it). 2- A few lines are copied redundantly in PageV02P427. 3- A missing title in PageV02P517. 4- I created a “CHANGE URI” issue for this file, since the name is wrong and it is in a wrong folder.
