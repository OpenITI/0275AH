90#VERS#COMMENT##: This book does not have any title and all the page
            numbers are wrong. The only thing that gives the book a kind of
            structure is the numbers of hadiths, but all the numbers were missing in
            Editpro text! I found all of them and added them to the text because
            such books are useless without the number of hadiths. 2- At the
            beginning of each number there must be “حدثنی الزبیر قال” which is
            missing in Editpro text (from number 69 ff sometimes there is another
            “حدثنی” before this passage which is also missing). 3- Pages 509-512 are
            missing.
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
