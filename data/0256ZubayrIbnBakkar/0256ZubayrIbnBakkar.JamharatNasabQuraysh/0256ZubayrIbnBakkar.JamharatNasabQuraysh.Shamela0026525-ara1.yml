90#VERS#COMMENT##: Books about Nasab of people and tribes are very
    difficult for tagging. I tagged this text twice to find the correct
    structure. Some explanations: 1- Some titles are repeated several times
    redundantly. I untagged them but showed them with two asterisks (i.e. #
    **) so that they are distinguishable. 2- The tagged names under each
    title (“ومن ولد ...”) must be his children, but sometimes the author
    names some other persons that are related to the children. I tagged
    these persons with an asterisk (i.e. ### $ *) so that they are
    distinguishable from the children. 3- I used the tag for a group of
    names (i.e. ### $$$$) when the author names more than one child in a
    line. 4- Missing parts: A missing title in page 236; a missing name in
    page 259; a missing line in page 407. 5- These titles (taken from the
    descriptive table of contents at the end of the book) must be added to
    their respective pages so that the book gains a clear structure (I just
    put a blank header instead of them but I didn’t add them because I’m not
    allowed to add anything to the text; However, they must be added
    anyway): 70: “عباد بن عبد الله بن الزبير”; 80: “ثابت بن عبد الله”; 97:
    “ومن ولد ثابت”; 115: “مصعب بن ثابت بن عبد الله بن الزبير”; 203 : “ومن
    ولد عبد الله بن مصعب”; 236: “ولد المنذر بن الزبير”; 249: “ومن ولد المنذر
    بن الزبير”; 258: “ومن ولد المنذر بن الزبير”; 297: “ومن ولد الزبير بن
    هشام بن عروة”; 299: “هشام بن عروة” (?).  6- The structure of the book
    can still become more accurate; because some parts could not be tagged
    (structurally). For example, inside a biographical tag, the author
    digresses to explain about someone related to him (See page 156 ff for
    example, which is mostly about “طلحة”, the grandfather of “أبوبكر” until
    page 163 in which the author returns to “أبوبكر” again). I can’t tag
    such names, because they are not part of the structure of the text. Many
    of the children of the main persons cannot be tagged too, since they are
    inside the text and are not part of the structure of the text. 7- A
    problem in METADATA: “مطبعة المدني” is the printing company. The
    publisher is “مكتبة دار العروبة”.
