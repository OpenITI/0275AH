90#VERS#COMMENT##: The link in VERS#LINKS that HRH have used for
    collation (and is exactly the same as the digital edition) leads you to
    a payment-based website and you must have an account to see the
    contents. PV removed the editorial sections NB: the digitized version
    does not contain: 3 - al-Risāla al-ʿUthmāniyya (pp. 127-328)
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
    removed by HRH and MGR (OpenITI Clean operation, 2023)
