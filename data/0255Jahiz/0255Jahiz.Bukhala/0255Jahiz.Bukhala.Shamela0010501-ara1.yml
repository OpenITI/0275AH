90#VERS#COMMENT##: The link in VERS#LINKS that I have used for collation
    (and is exactly the same as the digital edition) leads you to a payment-
    based website and you must have an account to see the contents.
    NB: check lines of poetry that seem too long: line numbers 1022
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
